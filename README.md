# mini-projects-in-Js
mini projects I do in Js while learning the language:
- a digital clock
- a guessing game- the computer decides on a number between 1-20 and asks the player to guess the number.
The player knows the range. After the player guesses the number, a message will tell him how many guesses it took, and then the game restarts.
- interactive stopwatch:in the format of hours:minutes:seconds.include 3 buttons: start\resume, pause, and reset.
Clicking on the "start\resume" button while the stopwatch is running, or clicking on the "pause" button before the stopWatch has started or if it has already paused, will evoke a message for around a second (like "The stopWatch is already running" for the first case).
